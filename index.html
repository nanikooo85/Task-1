            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
          HTML is <strong>a markup language</strong> that web browsers use to
          interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or
          audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML
          markup are<br />
          defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
          enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the<br>
          text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR
          9537<br />
          Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text
          formatting languages such as that used by the <b>RUNOFF</b> command
          developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing
          System)<br />
          operating system.
          <em
            >These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
            typesetters to manually format documents.</em
          >
          the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
          annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects,<br>
          with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.<br />
